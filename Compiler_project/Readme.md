Implementation of a expression compiler (mathematical operations)

Here we are buliding a compiler code that will convert the mathematical expression into a assembly code with arm fpu.

The expression length can be variable and it should have only round brackets. If the number of starting and ending bracket does not match then, error will be thrown.

Run code ussing any C compilor and you will get an output assembly file that will directly run on KEIL assembler (fpu single presion should be enabled in KEIL).

Power and modulo operations are not supported in this version.
